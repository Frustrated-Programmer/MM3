# Mausoleum Mansion 3 (Clone)
Find the original at [MM3](https://github.com/TemporalFuzz/mm3)<br>
Owner of MM3 is [TemporalFuzz](https://github.com/TemporalFuzz)<br>

TemporalFuzz decided to not host MM3 anymore.<br>
But Due to popular requests he made MM3 open source so others ~~like me~~<br>
Could host MM3 for others.


In order for me to host MM3, I need the repo that **I** control on github.
<br>So this is it!
